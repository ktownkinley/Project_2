# In this project, we refined our skills using ETL to clean up and structure the data from a crowdfunding xlsx and create CSVs that could be imported into a PostgreSQL database.

# In the ipynb file, we used Pandas to import the files, clean the data, and export the resulting DataFrames to CSV files that were ready for import into the database.

# The schema.sql file creates the required tables and relationships to effectively join all the infomation in an ERD that is ready for data import.

# The resulting database was queried and displayed all the data correctly.
